# VEKT - Revolutionary Typography Vectorization

## Project Description
VEKT represents a breakthrough in mathematical typography processing, achieving revolutionary performance in converting raster typography to perfect vector representations. The system processes historical documents, foundry specimens, and degraded sources with equal precision.

## Key Achievements
- **54+ million pixels/second processing speed**
- **Perfect hole transparency detection**
- **Universal source compatibility**
- **Dual-tier output system** (archival + enhanced)

## Technical Foundation
Built on proven R Laboratory algorithms adapted for typography processing, VEKT demonstrates that mathematical precision can be achieved in vector conversion without sacrificing processing speed or source compatibility.

## Strategic Vision
The Wild Horizons manifesto outlines expansion from typography processing to universal vector applications including scientific visualization, cultural preservation, and AI training data generation.

## Legal Status
All code released under AGPL-3.0. Prior art documented and timestamped. Community contributions welcome under contributor license agreement.
